Haskell library for Sources, Sinks and Transformers.
The data is pushed from the source through the transfomers into the sink. The sink or a transfomer can decide at any time to end the transfer (see Iteratees).
The transformers are very reusable since they can not depend on side effects, so they can be used with files as well as with simple lists.

Allows to build pipelines such as
  ghci> listSource [1..10] $$ T.map(+1) =$= T.buffer 3 0 (+) =$ listSink
  [9,18,27,11]

Available Sources at the moment:
 - List
 - Handle (IO)
 - File

Available Sinks at the moment:
 - List
 - Handle (IO)
 - File
